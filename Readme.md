# John the Zero   _version 4.0 !!!!_
## _The Learner_


## Who am I ?

I'm just a learner, trying to understand how things are working and how we can make the things working for the others.

## Skills

- I can teach maths and physics 
- I can make the others better 
- I never stop learning

## What do I love the most ?

- enjoying my time with my family
- eating 
- learn more and more ( and eat at the same time ! ) 
- learn about physics, IT, biology or maths.
    
## Which are my fears ?

- I'm scared of asking myself the wrong questions and wasting too much time on problems that could have been solved faster with the appropriate question.
- I'm scared of being a coffee-addict ( and sharks )
    
## My objectives for the future as a developper !!

1. Helping people to realize they can actually do things !
    > Everybody can be lost but not everybody can be helped by somebody else !
2. Helping people how to get rid of the fears that put in their way to go forward !
    > Fear can actually make you think than you are not able to learn.
3. Educate people about code and sciences 
    > Not creating a rocket or a worldwide known application doesn't make you a stupid person !

## The things I'm looking forward to 

1. I wish I can have an overall understanding of how front-end and back-end works and how the can be efficiently related together.

##  Things I value the most in a team 

- respect for the others and understanding that we all came from different backgrounds
- communication
- have fun !
